Mean center frequency of the 4-pole allpass filters which are in series with the delays. Their frequency-dependent phase shifts can create a "Phaser" effect.
The phase shift is minimized by setting Allpass Tune to its maximum.
When the Time of the Flanger is set to zero the allpass becomes the dominant part.
